You will submit a body of text below this comment.

Required items inside the body must include how to get hired, required experience, expertise, slots available (Notify me when a slot has been taken), and other required things a person who is interested in the job must have.

A Job Listing must be some sort of programming job.

If accepted, it will be listed. Once the total number of slots is filled, the Listing will be deleted.

Job Listings that have not received attention (or lack of communication on slot fills) within 15 days of the last slot fill will be removed.

You cannot request again within 30 days of Job Removal.
